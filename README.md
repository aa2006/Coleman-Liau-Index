# Coleman-Liau-Index
Calculate the US reading grade level for any given text using the Coleman-Liau Index.

## Use
Compile the program using gcc for C and g++ for C++
```bash
gcc readability.c -o readability
```
```bash
g++ readability.cpp -o readability
```
Run the program (make sure you're in the correct directory)
```bash
./reabability
```
It will prompt you for a text:
```bash
Text: 
```
You can enter any text, then press enter.
The program should then calculate the U.S. reading level for that text and output it.
